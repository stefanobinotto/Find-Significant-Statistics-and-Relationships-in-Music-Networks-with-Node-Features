# Find Significant Statistics and Relationships in Music Networks with Node Features

This repository contains the delivery of the final project for the Learning From Networks course at UniPD - DEI 2022/23.

Here is the [code](https://github.com/stefanobinotto/Graph-Analytics-and-Network-Features/blob/main/project.ipynb).

This project is about **graph analytics and network features**, consisting in an analysis of three music-related networks: **Artist Collaboration Networks**, **Genre Collaboration Networks**, **Hit Songs Networks**.

The goal was to find the **what artists and genres are most relevant**, based on year and geographic area, and **what songs are most relevant** based on music genre, year, geographic area and involved artists, using the techniques and algorithms studied during the course.

The analysis of these graphs characteristics is conducted using the **exact centrality scores** algorithms, and compared with the **Eppstein-Wang approximated scores**.

[This](https://github.com/stefanobinotto/Graph-Analytics-and-Network-Features/blob/main/Bastianello-Binotto-Grotto.pdf) is a presentation of our initial intentions, while [here](https://github.com/stefanobinotto/Graph-Analytics-and-Network-Features/blob/main/Report.pdf) you can find the final comprehensive discussion of our goals, our approach and the findings.
